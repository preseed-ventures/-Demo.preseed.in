                    <h1>My Story</h1>
                    <hr>
					<img src="aboutme/imagesabout/lolly.jpg" class="img-polaroid" style="margin:5px 0px 15px; */webkit-filter: brightness(1.9);filter: brightness(1.9);" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>At age 18, I realized that I was in an abusive relationship. I was overwhelmed and confused. How had this happened to me? When I finally managed to get out of the situation, I was shocked at the wounds it left in my being. As part of the healing process I did an advocacy training in domestic violence and began to speak with my peers about the topic. Later, while in college, I worked to address violence against women by working on the sexual assault task force. I learned about the complexities associated with the all too common experience of gender-based violence.
                    I decided to go to social work school in order to become a counselor. My first internship was at the Manhattan District Attorneys Office in their crime victims program where I worked with nearly all women involved in domestic violence. I was surprised at the wide range of women who were involved in abusive relationships. I had clients from many different cultures and class backgrounds, with varying levels of education and diverse personal histories. I was appalled at how dangerous some of their situations became and at how the legal system struggled to protect them.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Discovering Yoga and My Passion to Pass It On</h3>
                    I began to practice yoga as my form of self-care. The transformation I experienced on the mat helped me to heal the invisible wounds that remained after an experience with violence. I was working with survivors as a therapist and realized that if yoga could be so powerful for me that I wanted to share it with my clients.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>My Explorations of Healing In Other Cultures</h3>
                    I traveled to India and South America to explore spirituality and found meaning and value in many belief systems. The practices offered by Vedanta philosophy, Buddhism and Shamanism, taught me about the intangible part of ourselves which can be called the soul.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Realizing the Universality of Gender Based Violence</h3>
                    In my travels, I met women from around the world who shared the painful experience of surviving gender-based violence. I was surprised at hearing the same stories again and again. The realization that women in many different parts of the world including New York, New Delhi, Buenos Aires and Bogotá shared so much moved me to address this issue in my work.
                    I began to understand just how prevalent yet ignored this issue was and how debilitating the consequences could be. During my time in four major cities in Latin America I interviewed women about the topic of gender based violence. I was frustrated that violence against women is so widespread while resources for support are minimal.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>My Steps Toward Action</h3>
                    I did my 200 hour yoga teacher training with the Sivananda school in Medellin, Colombia. I returned home with a vision to integrate my mental health background, spiritual beliefs, yoga practice and passion for helping women around the world. I ran a pilot program introducing yoga to women survivors of violence in northern Uganda in the spring of 2013. The practice helped them to reduce physical pain and to realize their own value and self worth. It also lead them to begin to forgive those who had wronged them.
                    My vision is to continue to utilize my experiences and training to guide others on the path to be well and heal on all levels of their being. My approach integrates therapeutic modalities with the movement and breathing of yoga postures and an awareness of our spirit. This facilitates us on our journey to be balanced in mind, body and soul.

You have helped me break down relationships and situations to see the experience clearly without distractions of emotion or my own self-absorption which helps me in situations now where I reflect on events outside of just my personal view, attachments, and social constraints..</p>

			<p>you are a spiritual healer and that you focus on meditation as a means of becoming centered. I think you could support them by giving them some guidance material at first so that they can educate themselves a bit about healing from trauma and to see if this is the best path for them. Then you could answer any questions they might have, and you could ask them questions as well, perhaps questions they never thought of before, which might help them to understand the importance of going through the healing process.</p>

		<p>Lolly has helped me to learn visualizations such as someone's excessive mind chatter or negative vibes to enter into a big black cauldron instead of allowing those vibes be absorbed into my own being. It has helped me to protect myself and harness my own physical, mental & emotional energies. She also deepened my understanding of cord cutting through ceremony and visual techniques. I now feel more in charge of my healing progress and can now share this deep wisdom with others who may suffer from emotional/energetic wounds. It seems that the universe brought Lolly & I together at a time where we both were seeking female friendship with someone who was deeply rooted in Love. Thank you for bringing deep joy, feminine wisdom &&love into my life. Namaste.</p>

		<p>you helped to reflect back to me the way that i was judging myself as being either not enough or too much. our session helped bring awareness to how silly my fears and self-judgments are, which allows me to be less attached to these judgments, laugh at them, release them, notice them instead of feeling like they are the truth and move on with my day. you also helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, to feel normal, to love myself, my family and my friends even deeper. Thank you.</p>

			<p>You have helped me understand romantic relationships and relationships with friends and family by showing me a different perspective. You have helped me break down relationships and situations to see the experience clearly without distractions of emotion or my own self-absorption which helps me in situations now where I reflect on events outside of just my personal view, attachments, and social constraints..</p>

			<p>you are a spiritual healer and that you focus on meditation as a means of becoming centered. I think you could support them by giving them some guidance material at first so that they can educate themselves a bit about healing from trauma and to see if this is the best path for them. Then you could answer any questions they might have, and you could ask them questions as well, perhaps questions they never thought of before, which might help them to understand the importance of going through the healing process.</p>

		<p>Lolly has helped me to learn visualizations such as someone's excessive mind chatter or negative vibes to enter into a big black cauldron instead of allowing those vibes be absorbed into my own being. It has helped me to protect myself and harness my own physical, mental & emotional energies. She also deepened my understanding of cord cutting through ceremony and visual techniques. I now feel more in charge of my healing progress and can now share this deep wisdom with others who may suffer from emotional/energetic wounds. It seems that the universe brought Lolly & I together at a time where we both were seeking female friendship with someone who was deeply rooted in Love. Thank you for bringing deep joy, feminine wisdom &&love into my life. Namaste.</p>

		<p>you helped to reflect back to me the way that i was judging myself as being either not enough or too much. our session helped bring awareness to how silly my fears and self-judgments are, which allows me to be less attached to these judgments, laugh at them, release them, notice them instead of feeling like they are the truth and move on with my day. you also helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, to feel normal, to love myself, my family and my friends even deeper. Thank you.</p>

		<p>You helped me understand moon energy, although the euphoria of MDMA probably had a lot to do with it haha. I also felt that I was able to confront some conflict in myself relating to gender roles. I appreciated having you as a female friend, especially in a town where so much emphasis is placed on sexuality.</p>
