			<p>You have helped me understand romantic relationships and relationships with friends and family by showing me a different perspective. You have helped me break down relationships and situations to see the experience clearly without distractions of emotion or my own self-absorption which helps me in situations now where I reflect on events outside of just my personal view, attachments, and social constraints..</p>

			<p>you are a spiritual healer and that you focus on meditation as a means of becoming centered. I think you could support them by giving them some guidance material at first so that they can educate themselves a bit about healing from trauma and to see if this is the best path for them. Then you could answer any questions they might have, and you could ask them questions as well, perhaps questions they never thought of before, which might help them to understand the importance of going through the healing process.</p>

		<p>Lolly has helped me to learn visualizations such as someone's excessive mind chatter or negative vibes to enter into a big black cauldron instead of allowing those vibes be absorbed into my own being. It has helped me to protect myself and harness my own physical, mental & emotional energies. She also deepened my understanding of cord cutting through ceremony and visual techniques. I now feel more in charge of my healing progress and can now share this deep wisdom with others who may suffer from emotional/energetic wounds. It seems that the universe brought Lolly & I together at a time where we both were seeking female friendship with someone who was deeply rooted in Love. Thank you for bringing deep joy, feminine wisdom &&love into my life. Namaste.</p>

		<p>you helped to reflect back to me the way that i was judging myself as being either not enough or too much. our session helped bring awareness to how silly my fears and self-judgments are, which allows me to be less attached to these judgments, laugh at them, release them, notice them instead of feeling like they are the truth and move on with my day. you also helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, to feel normal, to love myself, my family and my friends even deeper. Thank you.</p>
