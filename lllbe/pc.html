                    <h2>Personal Coaching</h2>
                    <p>I offer individual guidance sessions to help you develop positive relationships in 
                    your life. I focus on assisting you to develop awareness of yourself. By cultivating 
                    your relationship to spirituality you can see the whole world through a meaningful 
                    perspective. The more you learn to love yourself and your own divinity, the easier it 
                    becomes to relate to others.

                    <i>Topics which Lolly be would cover</i> 
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Healing from Abusive Relationships</h4>
                    Emotional, Physical and Sexual Abuse in any intimate personal relationship is a 
                    trauma that requires strength to heal. This strength can blossom into an endless 
                    supply of divine love energy. One has to heal the body, from the physical 
                    manifestations of dis-ease and imbalance in the body. One must heal the mind, by 
                    developing mindfulness, we can change our thoughts, our feelings are influenced, 
                    and our actions follow. The neuroplasticity of the brain is phenomenal, we can 
                    actually rewire our brains.
                    <br>
                     <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Sacred Sexuality</h4>
                    For a human, one of our most divine and intense experiences is that of sexuality. 
                    This aspect has the potential to communicate and embody messages which cannot 
                    be put into words. Physical sexuality is a profound and vulnerable experience. When 
                    paired with love, it can be truly sacred. Many of us are not taught how to appreciate 
                    and healthily express this aspect of ourselves. Developing intimacy with one another 
                    is about opening up on several dimensions of connection with another being.
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Adoption</h4>
                    People who were adopted, and people who are adopting, anyone interested in 
                    adoption! I was adopted from another country and grew up in the USA. 
                    I have facilitated several girls workshops for adopted girls utilizing group work for 
                    self expression. With Lutheran Social Services.
                    <br>
                    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Healthy Relationships</h4>
                    Lolly be is an expert in managing domestic violence or intimate partner violence. She help people develop a healthy relationship.  She went through it before as a result of that she began to study relationships.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Tarot Card Readings</h1>
                     I trained in Rishikesh, India in 2014. I utilize the powers of the kabbalah through the 
                    Tarot cards and provide an interpretation of the energies showing up around you 
                    right now. I do not predict the future, I provide guidance on the current themes as 
                    they stand today. This allows you a fresh perspective on the dynamics present for 
                    you at this moment. We can then draw upon this to facilitate a guidance dialogue.</p>

			<p>You have helped me understand romantic relationships and relationships with friends and family by showing me a different perspective. You have helped me break down relationships and situations to see the experience clearly without distractions of emotion or my own self-absorption which helps me in situations now where I reflect on events outside of just my personal view, attachments, and social constraints..</p>

			<p>you are a spiritual healer and that you focus on meditation as a means of becoming centered. I think you could support them by giving them some guidance material at first so that they can educate themselves a bit about healing from trauma and to see if this is the best path for them. Then you could answer any questions they might have, and you could ask them questions as well, perhaps questions they never thought of before, which might help them to understand the importance of going through the healing process.</p>

		<p>Lolly has helped me to learn visualizations such as someone's excessive mind chatter or negative vibes to enter into a big black cauldron instead of allowing those vibes be absorbed into my own being. It has helped me to protect myself and harness my own physical, mental & emotional energies. She also deepened my understanding of cord cutting through ceremony and visual techniques. I now feel more in charge of my healing progress and can now share this deep wisdom with others who may suffer from emotional/energetic wounds. It seems that the universe brought Lolly & I together at a time where we both were seeking female friendship with someone who was deeply rooted in Love. Thank you for bringing deep joy, feminine wisdom &&love into my life. Namaste.</p>

		<p>you helped to reflect back to me the way that i was judging myself as being either not enough or too much. our session helped bring awareness to how silly my fears and self-judgments are, which allows me to be less attached to these judgments, laugh at them, release them, notice them instead of feeling like they are the truth and move on with my day. you also helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, to feel normal, to love myself, my family and my friends even deeper. Thank you.</p>

		<p>You helped me understand moon energy, although the euphoria of MDMA probably had a lot to do with it haha. I also felt that I was able to confront some conflict in myself relating to gender roles. I appreciated having you as a female friend, especially in a town where so much emphasis is placed on sexuality.</p>

			<p>You have helped me understand romantic relationships and relationships with friends and family by showing me a different perspective. You have helped me break down relationships and situations to see the experience clearly without distractions of emotion or my own self-absorption which helps me in situations now where I reflect on events outside of just my personal view, attachments, and social constraints..</p>

			<p>you are a spiritual healer and that you focus on meditation as a means of becoming centered. I think you could support them by giving them some guidance material at first so that they can educate themselves a bit about healing from trauma and to see if this is the best path for them. Then you could answer any questions they might have, and you could ask them questions as well, perhaps questions they never thought of before, which might help them to understand the importance of going through the healing process.</p>

		<p>Lolly has helped me to learn visualizations such as someone's excessive mind chatter or negative vibes to enter into a big black cauldron instead of allowing those vibes be absorbed into my own being. It has helped me to protect myself and harness my own physical, mental & emotional energies. She also deepened my understanding of cord cutting through ceremony and visual techniques. I now feel more in charge of my healing progress and can now share this deep wisdom with others who may suffer from emotional/energetic wounds. It seems that the universe brought Lolly & I together at a time where we both were seeking female friendship with someone who was deeply rooted in Love. Thank you for bringing deep joy, feminine wisdom &&love into my life. Namaste.</p>

		<p>you helped to reflect back to me the way that i was judging myself as being either not enough or too much. our session helped bring awareness to how silly my fears and self-judgments are, which allows me to be less attached to these judgments, laugh at them, release them, notice them instead of feeling like they are the truth and move on with my day. you also helped me to feel more comfortable in my own skin, to feel normal, to love myself, my family and my friends even deeper. Thank you.</p>
