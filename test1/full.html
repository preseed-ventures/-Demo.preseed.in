                    <br>
                    <p>At age 18, I realized that I was in an abusive relationship. I was overwhelmed and confused. How had this happened to me? When I finally managed to get out of the situation, I was shocked at the wounds it left in my being. As part of the healing process I did an advocacy training in domestic violence and began to speak with my peers about the topic. Later, while in college, I worked to address violence against women by working on the sexual assault task force. I learned about the complexities associated with the all too common experience of gender-based violence.
                    I decided to go to social work school in order to become a counselor. My first internship was at the Manhattan District Attorneys Office in their crime victims program where I worked with nearly all women involved in domestic violence. I was surprised at the wide range of women who were involved in abusive relationships. I had clients from many different cultures and class backgrounds, with varying levels of education and diverse personal histories. I was appalled at how dangerous some of their situations became and at how the legal system struggled to protect them.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Discovering Yoga and My Passion to Pass It On</h3>
                    I began to practice yoga as my form of self-care. The transformation I experienced on the mat helped me to heal the invisible wounds that remained after an experience with violence. I was working with survivors as a therapist and realized that if yoga could be so powerful for me that I wanted to share it with my clients.
                    <br>
                    <h3>My Explorations of Healing In Other Cultures</h3>
                    I traveled to India and South America to explore spirituality and found meaning and value in many belief systems. The practices offered by Vedanta philosophy, Buddhism and Shamanism, taught me about the intangible part of ourselves which can be called the soul.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Realizing the Universality of Gender Based Violence</h3>
                    In my travels, I met women from around the world who shared the painful experience of surviving gender-based violence. I was surprised at hearing the same stories again and again. The realization that women in many different parts of the world including New York, New Delhi, Buenos Aires and Bogotá shared so much moved me to address this issue in my work.
                    I began to understand just how prevalent yet ignored this issue was and how debilitating the consequences could be. During my time in four major cities in Latin America I interviewed women about the topic of gender based violence. I was frustrated that violence against women is so widespread while resources for support are minimal.
                    <br>
                    <h3>My Steps Toward Action</h3>
                    I did my 200 hour yoga teacher training with the Sivananda school in Medellin, Colombia. I returned home with a vision to integrate my mental health background, spiritual beliefs, yoga practice and passion for helping women around the world. I ran a pilot program introducing yoga to women survivors of violence in northern Uganda in the spring of 2013. The practice helped them to reduce physical pain and to realize their own value and self worth. It also lead them to begin to forgive those who had wronged them.
                    My vision is to continue to utilize my experiences and training to guide others on the path to be well and heal on all levels of their being. My approach integrates therapeutic modalities with the movement and breathing of yoga postures and an awareness of our spirit. This facilitates us on our journey to be balanced in mind, body and soul.
